I am porting the BluetoothK8IRRGBremote Arduino sketch over to PlatformIO. 
Currently it is written to use an external Bluetooth Module (accessed via serial)
It currently works best on Arduino Nano 

New version: ESP32 C3 with built-in bluetooth. This also has a built-in RGB LED on GPIO pin 8. 
We will be using ESP32 Bluetooth, but the same serial over bluetooth commands (coming from an app)
We need to include the bluetooth connection software for ESP32 C3
We can use FastLED Library for the WS2812 LED. 
We will be using PlatformIO best practises. Setting up from scratch.
